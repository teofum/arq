Break into jail and claim police brutality.
Never be led astray onto the path of virtue.
You will forget that you ever knew me.
Your society will be sought by people of taste and refinement.
You will be honored for contributing your time and skill to a worthy cause.
Expect the worst, it's the least you can do.
You may not get this fortune
